# About Webhook.site

With [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site), you instantly get a unique, random URL and e-mail address. Everything that's sent to these addresses are shown instantly. With this, you can test and debug Webhooks and HTTP requests, as well as create your own workflows using the [Custom Actions](/custom-actions.html) graphical editor or [WebhookScript](/webhookscript.html), a simple scripting language, to transform, validate and process HTTP requests in a variety of ways – without setting up and maintaining your own infrastructure.

What are customers using Webhook.site for?

* Receive Webhooks without needing an internet-facing Web server
* Use Webhook.site as an intermediary, proxying requests and being able to see what was sent in the past
* Send Webhooks to a server that's behind a firewall or private subnet
* Transforming Webhooks into other formats, and re-sending them to different systems
* Connect different APIs that aren't compatible
* Building contact forms that send emails
* Instantly build APIs without needing infrastructure

The following video is a quick demo of Webhook.site Custom Actions is used to set up a workflow to post updates from a news page to an X/Twitter account automatically.
